# Goal

Kaggle competition to predict NYC taxi travel times. The report for the project is at capstone.pdf.

## Overview

i perform this project on dekstop with using Jupyter_Notebook and also perform  without using Jupyter_notebook  on remote server using python.

## Software and Libraries
- Python 3
- Scikit-learn: Pythonâ€™s open source machine learning library
- XGBoost: Python package for XGBoost model,

## Datasets
The primary train dataset (train.csv) and test dataset (test.csv) is at the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/data">Kaggle competition website</a>.

The weather dataset is at: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mathijs/weather-data-in-new-york-city-2016">weather_data_nyc_centralpark_2016.csv</a>.

The datasets for the fastest routes from OSRM can be found <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/oscarleo/new-york-city-taxi-with-osrm>here</a>. The files are:  fastest_routes_train_part_1.csv, fastest_routes_train_part_2.csv, and fastest_routes_test.csv
