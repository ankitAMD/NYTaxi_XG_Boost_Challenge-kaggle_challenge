# Nyc-taxi-Kaggle-challenge

# Goal

Kaggle competition to predict NYC taxi travel times. The report for the project is at capstone.pdf.

## PROBLEM S TATEMENT
In this report, we look at a Kaggle competition with data from the NYC Taxi and
Limousine Commission, which asks competitors to predict the total ride time
(trip_duration) of taxi trips in New York City. The data provided by Kaggle is structured
data provided as a CSV file. The data in the CSV file includes multiple formats: timestamps,
text, and numerical data. This is a regression analysis, since the output, total ride time, is
numerical. I will use several machine learning methods for the prediction task, which are
linear regression, k-nearest neighbors regression, random forests, and XGBoost. The
models will be evaluated using the root mean squared logarithmic error.

## Overview

i perform this project on dekstop with using Jupyter_Notebook and also perform  without using Jupyter_notebook  on remote server using python.

## Software and Libraries
- Python 3
- Scikit-learn: Pythonâ€™s open source machine learning library
- XGBoost: Python package for XGBoost model,

## Datasets
The primary train dataset (train.csv) and test dataset (test.csv) is at the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/data">Kaggle competition website</a>.

The weather dataset is at: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mathijs/weather-data-in-new-york-city-2016">weather_data_nyc_centralpark_2016.csv</a>.

The datasets for the fastest routes from OSRM can be found <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/oscarleo/new-york-city-taxi-with-osrm>here</a>. The files are:  fastest_routes_train_part_1.csv, fastest_routes_train_part_2.csv, and fastest_routes_test.csv

scikit-learn is used to build models. It should not be used for reading the data, manipulating and summarizing it. There are 

better libraries for that (e.g. NumPy, Pandas etc.)
